                                    Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue in D minor, BWV 903
                                </h3>

                                <p>
                                    Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), from Germany, was one of the greatest composers
                                    and musician of the Baroque era. In the 18th century, Bach focused on keyboard music
                                    most of time. He created German styles by using counterpoint, harmonic and motive
                                    organisation.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue in D minor was probably composed around 1720s for
                                    harpsichord. Now it is often a piano piece. Bach only composed a few Fantasia and
                                    Fugue. In these pieces, fantasia is always presented as prelude before fugue. For
                                    this piece, some of scholars think the tile is from number of chromatic modulations
                                    in fantasy movement, and others think it is because of the subject melody in Fugue.
                                    Also, the content is uncertain. In different manuscripts, some details are not same,
                                    even no any modern edition can adjust which is right.</p>
                                <p>
                                    As Koravaar said, different from other Bach's work, this piece is an extraordinary
                                    piece which is large, sprawling, emotional and unique in characters. In the piece,
                                    the fantasia has 3 main sections: the first part is a true prelude, the second is
                                    recitative section, and the third mix them together. In addition, some scholars
                                    think the arpeggio part before recitative section is a separate section. In the
                                    first section, it has highly virtuosic, and the form is similar to toccata. For the
                                    second section, in musically, it is a challenge for pianist to show the huge
                                    emotional changing in the recitative part. In harmony aspect, Bach used a wide range
                                    of key. Although the main cadence is from tonic D minor to dominant then returning
                                    back to tonic, Bach still put some tricks in the fantasy. In the first section, Bach
                                    composed the melody with continually key changing to create an excited atmosphere.
                                    When music goes into the second section, counterpoint suddenly stops, and melody
                                    which sounds like soprano come out. Even in this section, melody sound like
                                    chromatic imitations and atonal, Bach still put effort on keeping the key to tonic.
                                    And finally, in the end, the key returns back to tonic with a D note pedal.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The subject of the fugue is a long subject. Bach added chromatic scale into the
                                    subject as an element. At the end of this piece, Bach wrote an unusual scale. He
                                    used octave to perform this a series of note. This is not common in the Baroque era,
                                    and Bach often avoided to use it, because parallel 8th does not conform with normal
                                    harmony progression. But Bach used it for create heavy and serious feeling. Moroney
                                    said: Bach usually obey the rules, but always wrote for the ear.

                                <h3>Mozart Piano Sonata no.1 in C major, K.279</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) was a representative composer of the Classical
                                    era. Mozart was demonstrated in the music of his extraordinary talent when he was
                                    young. He was not only good at playing violin and piano, but also composed his music
                                    when he was 5. His music is enriching of amount of character and emotional, almost
                                    including full range of human's emotions. Fischer has said: “Mozart is a touchstone
                                    of the heart. If I want to show my love to a dear person, I sit down at the piano
                                    and play for her a piece of Mozart”.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Mozart composed his first 6 pieces of sonata in 1775 when he was in Munich. Also,
                                    this is the first time Mozart composed for fortepiano. He took full advantage of the
                                    obvious feature of fortepiano to compose this sonata. Fortepiano has a larger range
                                    of dynamic. So, in these pieces, there are serval dynamic marks appears in the
                                    score, and he use bass part to present sonorous sounds. </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is widely believed that Allegro in K.279 is Mozart's first work. All three
                                    movements are in sonata form. Different from other sonata, as the first work,
                                    Allegro movement does not have a significant character in the beginning. The theme
                                    still has a Baroque feeling. All melodies and structure in the first movement are
                                    straightforward. But end of this movement, Mozart extended fragmentation in the last
                                    2 bars to make surprise. </p>
                                <p>
                                    The character in the second movement is richer than the first movement. In the
                                    beginning, Mozart created warm and peaceful feeling. He always composed the slow
                                    movement with an idyllic feeling, and he also used in this movement. In the middle
                                    of exposition, Mozart changed dynamic continually in each fragmentation to push the
                                    feeling to the negative side. Paavili illustrated that: “Mozart was a master of
                                    articulating the nuances of happiness and unhappiness”. In this movement, he used
                                    different dynamic to aggravate the conflict of happiness and sadness.

                                <h3>Prokofiev Piano Sonata no.6 in A major, Op.82</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev (1891-1953) was a Russian Soviet composer. His famous
                                    works includes the March from The Love for Three Oranges, the ballet Romeo and
                                    Juliet and Peter and the Wolf. Because of these works, he is regarded as one of the
                                    greatest composers of the 20th century.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The Nazi invasion of the USSR incited him to compose amount of works. Prokofiev
                                    Piano Sonata no.6&7&8 are the pieces he created during this time, and these three
                                    sonatas are often called “3 War Sonatas”. Prokofiev Piano Sonata no.6 is the first
                                    of “War Sonatas”. Prokofiev started to write these pieces from 1939, and he finished
                                    composing no.6 in 1940. This sonata includes number of elements of Prokofiev’s piano
                                    composing style, such as complex rhythm, percussive attack, and dissonance
                                    harmonies. This piece had
                                    played twice in 1940. On April 8th, Prokofiev played on a broadcast, and on November
                                    26th, Sviatoslav Richter played it in his public concert at the Small Hall of the
                                    Moscow Conservatory. After well- received debuts from the first two performance,
                                    many musicians gave positive feedback. Even Dmitri Shostakovich, who’s a picky
                                    person, said: “The Sixth Sonata is magnificent, from beginning to end. I am happy
                                    that I had the opportunity to hear it two times, and regret that it was only two
                                    times.” In the biography of Prokofiev, Hanson noted: “The composer’s joyous,
                                    vigorous, intensely musical personality is expressed in every opus and in none more
                                    strikingly than the 6th sonata. It was one of the most extroverted sonatas he was to
                                    write, and one of the finest.”

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Prokofiev Piano Sonata no.6 has 4 movements. Although the content of this piece is
                                    modernity, this piece is still a traditional sonata form. Main theme of the first
                                    movement is aggressive. 3 notes motive in excited rhythm creates a nervous and
                                    vehement atmosphere. In addition, it is impressive that these motive repeats amount
                                    of time in the first movement even appears in the 4th movement. From the second
                                    subject, melody becomes more tranquillo. In the development section, Prokofiev added
                                    motive in it and gradually lead music to recapitulation. In the last bar, Prokofiev
                                    used the lowest range of piano to create an imagination of war. In addition, he also
                                    used it in the end of last movement. The second movement is a quick march, and the
                                    middle section is more cantabile. The quiet ending in the second movement makes
                                    emotion move to the third movement more natural. The waltz feeling in lentissimo and
                                    luxuriant harmony makes this movement sound expressive and fragile. To the last
                                    movement, the character changed and is variable. It is a toccata with different
                                    emotions. Sometimes it is breathless, sometimes it has playful dancing feeling. When
                                    the motive in the 1st movement return in this movement, whatever it is played by
                                    slow tempo or fast, it still creates the atmosphere like horror. In the last 2 bars,
                                    Prokofiev used semiquavers play the highest and lowest range of keyboard to push the
                                    feeling of war to the highest point. </p>
